        Hacktivist group <strong>DieNet</strong> claims to have compromised the personal and professional accounts of Jackson County Deputy Sheriff <strong>Gabriel W. Woods</strong>. The group posted data including personal emails, Social Security documents, law enforcement credentials, and government account updates to their Telegram channel on July 22 and 23. <br><br>
        
        DieNet also accessed Woods’s Missouri state government portal account, allegedly changing email, password, and profile settings. The messages were accompanied by a political statement condemning US support for Israel’s actions in Gaza, warning that law enforcement and military systems are “exposed” and that this breach is “only the beginning.”<br><br>
        
        According to Woods’s publicly available biography, he served with the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office and retained firearm privileges after retirement. The hack appears to have exploited his personal account security.<br><br>
        
        DieNet justified the attack by stating “A little stupidity in American officers makes them pay attention and click on some links,” and “Actions have consequences,” framing it as retaliation for US policies. <br><br>
        
        SpyoSecure urges law enforcement and public sector personnel to review their account security, use strong authentication, and monitor for unusual account changes. This incident highlights how personal data exposure can accompany politically-motivated cyberattacks.
