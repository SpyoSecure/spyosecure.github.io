        On July 13, 2025, the official X (formerly Twitter) account of <strong>Elmo</strong> was compromised by an unknown attacker. The account began posting offensive and antisemitic content, including a direct challenge to U.S. President Donald Trump to “release the files” referring to the alleged Jeffrey Epstein client list. <br><br>

        Hackmanac Cyber News was among the first to report the breach via their Telegram channel. The messages, which spread quickly, sparked backlash before they were swiftly deleted. <br><br>

        <a href="https://www.foxla.com/news/elmo-hacked-x-release-the-files-trump" target="_blank">FoxLA</a> confirmed the incident, showing screenshots of the deleted posts and reporting that Sesame Workshop acknowledged the breach. They also confirmed that all unauthorized content has been removed. <br><br>

        <strong>SpyoSecure</strong> can independently confirm that the posts are no longer visible on Elmo’s X timeline at this time.
