      <div class="article-body">
        The hacker group <strong>Tunisian Maskers Cyber Force</strong> has announced that it will no longer carry out cyberattacks, stating that it is temporarily withdrawing from the scene. The message, posted on their Telegram channel, read:<br><br>

        <em>"We announce that we will never launch any attacks again and will temporarily withdraw from the scene due to some pressures. Thank you to everyone who supported us, everyone who stood with us, and everyone who followed us. Thank you."</em><br><br>

        While the group did not clarify the nature of the pressures, the cybersecurity community suspects potential government monitoring or legal threats as a contributing factor. In recent years, multiple hacktivist groups have faced increased scrutiny as law enforcement agencies improve their cyber tracking tools and international cooperation.<br><br>

        This development also highlights the growing importance of <strong>Operational Security (OpSec)</strong>. Groups operating in high-risk environments must maintain strict communication discipline and anonymity to avoid identification. Even small digital slip-ups — like reusing handles or accessing accounts from exposed IPs — can lead to deanonymization.<br><br>

        It remains unclear whether Tunisian Maskers' departure is permanent or if the group will re-emerge under a new name or structure.
