        The suspected administrator of <strong>xss.is</strong>, a major Russian-speaking cybercrime forum, was arrested in Ukraine following a coordinated multi-year investigation. The forum was widely known as a key marketplace and communication hub for cybercriminals to trade malware, sell stolen data, offer ransomware services, and provide access to compromised computer systems.<br><br>
        
        The site has been seized and taken offline. According to Europol, the suspect was active for nearly 20 years and is believed to have facilitated cybercrime operations generating around seven million euros in profit.<br><br>
        
        This operation was led by French law enforcement with strong support from Europol and Ukrainian security agencies. It represents a major disruption to one of the backbone platforms used by Russian-speaking cybercriminals.<br><br>
        
        Authorities are now analyzing the seized data to support ongoing investigations and dismantle criminal networks operating across Europe and beyond.
