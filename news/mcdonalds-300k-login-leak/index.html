        A hacker going by the name <strong>xCapuche1337</strong> has posted what they claim is a database of over 300,000 McDonald's login credentials. The leak was spotted and shared by <strong>Dark Web Informer</strong> on social media. <br><br>

        Since the image was intentionally blurred by Dark Web Informer, the exact content of the leak cannot be confirmed. However, given the context and the hackerâ€™s claim of leaked logins, it most likely contains usernames, passwords, and associated email addresses. <br><br>

        As of now, McDonald's has not made any public comment about the alleged breach. The origin of the data is unclear, and there is no confirmation whether the credentials are current, valid, or associated with customers or employees. <br><br>

        SpyoSecure recommends users immediately change any reused McDonald's login credentials, enable two factor authentication, and monitor for suspicious account activity.
