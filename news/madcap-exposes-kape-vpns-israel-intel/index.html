        Hacktivist group <strong>MadCap</strong>, known for pro-Palestinian cyber activity, posted new revelations on July 28 and 29 warning users against several major VPN services allegedly connected to Israel Intelligence through a parent company called <strong>Kape Technologies</strong>. <br><br>

        According to MadCapâ€™s Telegram channel, Kape Technologies owns VPN providers like <strong>ExpressVPN</strong>, <strong>CyberGhost VPN</strong>, <strong>Private Internet Access</strong>, and <strong>ZenMate</strong>. The group urges users to avoid these VPNs, claiming they could be leaking user data to Israeli Intelligence infrastructure. <br><br>

        On July 29, MadCap followed up by revealing that Kape Technologies was formerly known as Crossrider, a company identified as an adware distributor. The rebranding allegedly served to distance the company from its past reputation. Contact information for individuals associated with Crossrider and Kape was also shared publicly by the group. <br><br>

        These findings have reignited concerns among privacy-focused users and cybersecurity professionals. The allegations, if true, suggest that tools designed to protect online anonymity may in fact be undermining it. <br><br>

        <strong>SpyoSecure</strong> would like to give big credit to MadCap for shedding light on these connections. As someone who truly values user privacy and digital protection, I personally would never want my data shared with Israel Intelligence or any government surveillance entity. We believe users deserve transparency and trust in the tools they use. <br><br>

        For those seeking safe alternatives, <strong>SpyoSecure recommends using <a href="https://mullvad.net/">Mullvad VPN</a></strong>, a trusted, no-logs VPN provider with a strong reputation for defending user privacy. <br><br>

        As you are online, so are the bad guys.
