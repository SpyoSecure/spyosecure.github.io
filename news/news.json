    "description": "The hacker group <strong>Tunisian Maskers Cyber Force</strong> announced that they will temporarily withdraw from the scene and stop launching attacks, citing 'pressures' as the reason. The message posted on Telegram thanked supporters and followers for standing with them.\n\nThis move raises questions about government surveillance and legal risks faced by hacktivist groups. As authorities improve their cyber tracking capabilities, maintaining strict <strong>Operational Security (OpSec)</strong> has become crucial. SpyoSecure will monitor for any return or shift in the groupâ€™s activities."
