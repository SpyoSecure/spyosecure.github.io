      <div class="article-body">
        The dating safety app known as <strong>Tea</strong> has been hit by a serious data breach that compromised over <strong>one hundred and thirty thousand images</strong> along with private posts and messages from its members. The breach affected users who signed up before February 2024 and includes photos women submitted to verify their identity such as <strong>driver's licenses</strong>, <strong>passports</strong> and other forms of ID. These sensitive documents were required before access was granted to the app and were supposed to be deleted immediately after verification, but instead were <strong>stored in a database that was later hacked</strong>. <br><br>

        The leaked content includes <strong>seventy two thousand ID related images</strong> and an additional <strong>fifty nine thousand posts and messages</strong> taken from the app's servers. Despite Tea's privacy policy and claims that data was automatically deleted, it appears the verification content remained stored. <br><br>

        Tea is a women only app from the United States with over <strong>one point six million users</strong>. It allows users to perform background checks on men they date including checking for marriage records and criminal status. One of its most talked about features is the ability to <strong>share red flags or green flags</strong> about people they have dated in order to warn or praise them. <br><br>

        The company insists that none of the leaked ID images can be linked directly to user posts. It also blocks screenshots to stop external sharing of internal content. However, the additional messages and photos from over two years ago <strong>were accessed during the breach</strong>. <br><br>

        Tea says it is now working with <strong>cybersecurity professionals</strong> to protect the community and has promised to take every necessary step going forward. <br><br>

        The app was founded by <strong>Sean Cook</strong> in November 2022. He was inspired by his motherâ€™s experience with online dating and hoped to build a safer environment for women. Cook once said he was shocked at how little traditional dating apps do to protect people from online scammers and fake identities. <br><br>

        However, the app has faced backlash from both men and women who argue that it may encourage defamation and privacy violations by letting users share personal stories without oversight. <br><br>

        Regardless of opinion, the breach highlights just how critical it is for platforms that promise security and anonymity to follow through on their technical claims. Storing identity documents without encryption or deletion contradicts the very purpose of a safety app. <br><br>

        As you are online, so are the bad guys.
